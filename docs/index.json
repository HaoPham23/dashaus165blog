More formally, a finite field is a field $(F, +, \\cdot)$ where $F$ is a finite set of elements, and $+$ and $\\cdot$ are binary operations on $F$ that satisfy the following axioms: $(F, +)$ is an abelian group. $(F\\setminus{0}, \\cdot)$ is an abelian group. The distributive law holds: $a\\cdot (b+c) = a\\cdot b + a\\cdot c$ for all $a,b,c\\in F$. In other words, a finite field is a field where addition and multiplication are well-defined, and where the set of elements is finite.

This field is denoted by $\\mathbb{F}_p$, and consists of the integers $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1$. Addition and multiplication are performed modulo $p$, so that for example $5 + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$ and $3 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. It can be shown that $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is a field under these operations. Another example of a finite field is the field of integers modulo a power of a prime. For example, the field $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ consists of the polynomials of degree at most 1 with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_p$, i.e. the set ${0, 1, x, x+1}$ where addition and multiplication are performed modulo $p$ and with the rule $x^2 = x+1$. This field is also a finite field.

Here are some of the most important properties: Every finite field has a prime power order. That is, if $F$ is a finite field with $q$ elements, then $q=p^n$ for some prime $p$ and some positive integer $n$. Conversely, every field of order $p^n$ is isomorphic to the field of integers modulo $p^n$. Finite fields are unique up to isomorphism. That is, if $F$ and $F’$ are two finite fields with the same number of elements, then there exists an isomorphism $\\phi:F\\to F’$. Addition and multiplication tables for a finite field can be represented by a matrix of size $q\\times q$, where $q$ is the number of elements in the field. These matrices have many interesting properties, including being invertible and having a non-zero determinant. The non-zero elements of a finite field form a cyclic group under multiplication. This group is generated by a primitive element of the field, i.e. an element $g$ such that every non-zero element of the field can be expressed as a power of $g$.

These principles include: Wave-Particle Duality: According to quantum mechanics, particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This means that particles can exist in a superposition of states, where they can be in multiple positions or energy levels at the same time. Quantization of Energy: The energy of a particle is not continuous, but rather comes in discrete units known as quanta. The energy of a particle is determined by its wave function, which describes the probability of finding the particle in a particular energy state. Uncertainty Principle: According to the uncertainty principle, it is impossible to know the precise position and momentum of a particle at the same time. This means that the more accurately we know the position of a particle, the less accurately we can know its momentum, and vice versa.
