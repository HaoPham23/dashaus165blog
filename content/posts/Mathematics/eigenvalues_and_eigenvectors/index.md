# Introduction to Finite Fields
Finite fields, also known as Galois fields, are algebraic structures that are widely used in many areas of mathematics, including cryptography, coding theory, and number theory. In this article, we will introduce the basics of finite fields and explore some of their properties.

## Definition
A finite field is a field that contains a finite number of elements. More formally, a finite field is a field $(F, +, \cdot)$ where $F$ is a finite set of elements, and $+$ and $\cdot$ are binary operations on $F$ that satisfy the following axioms:

- $(F, +)$ is an abelian group.
- $(F\setminus{0}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group.
- The distributive law holds: $a\cdot (b+c) = a\cdot b + a\cdot c$ for all $a,b,c\in F$.

In other words, a finite field is a field where addition and multiplication are well-defined, and where the set of elements is finite.

## Examples
There are many examples of finite fields, but perhaps the most well-known is the field of integers modulo a prime $p$. This field is denoted by $\mathbb{F}_p$, and consists of the integers $0, 1, 2, \ldots, p-1$. Addition and multiplication are performed modulo $p$, so that for example $5 + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{12}$ and $3 \cdot 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{12}$. It can be shown that $\mathbb{F}_p$ is a field under these operations.

Another example of a finite field is the field of integers modulo a power of a prime. For example, the field $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ consists of the polynomials of degree at most 1 with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_p$, i.e. the set ${0, 1, x, x+1}$ where addition and multiplication are performed modulo $p$ and with the rule $x^2 = x+1$. This field is also a finite field.

## Properties
Finite fields have many interesting properties that make them useful in various applications. Here are some of the most important properties:

- Every finite field has a prime power order. That is, if $F$ is a finite field with $q$ elements, then $q=p^n$ for some prime $p$ and some positive integer $n$. Conversely, every field of order $p^n$ is isomorphic to the field of integers modulo $p^n$.
- Finite fields are unique up to isomorphism. That is, if $F$ and $F'$ are two finite fields with the same number of elements, then there exists an isomorphism $\phi:F\to F'$.
Addition and multiplication tables for a finite field can be represented by a matrix of size $q\times q$, where $q$ is the number of elements in the field. These matrices have many interesting properties, including being invertible and having a non-zero determinant.
- The non-zero elements of a finite field form a cyclic group under multiplication. This group is generated by a primitive element of the field, i.e. an element $g$ such that every non-zero element of the field can be expressed as a power of $g$.

## Conclusion
Finite fields are fascinating algebraic structures with many interesting properties. They are used in a wide range of applications, including coding theory, cryptography, and number theory.
